# 1️⃣ Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a production-oriented healthcare analytics and machine learning system designed to support hospital operational decision-making and patient admission risk prediction.

Healthcare organisations must continuously balance:

- Increasing patient demand
- Capacity constraints
- Operational efficiency
- Clinical risk management
- Patient experience

This platform simulates real-world hospital operational challenges by:

- Forecasting daily patient volume
- Monitoring average wait times
- Evaluating department-level admission rates
- Predicting patient admission probability in real time

The system follows a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, integrates a DuckDB analytical warehouse, deploys a Random Forest admission prediction model, exposes REST endpoints via FastAPI, and delivers an interactive decision-support dashboard using Streamlit.

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of healthcare data science delivery — from data engineering to model deployment, cloud hosting, and governance considerations.

# 2️⃣ Data Governance & Responsible AI Considerations

Although this project uses non-sensitive educational data, the architecture reflects best practices required in real-world healthcare environments.

## Data Privacy & GDPR Alignment

In production healthcare systems:

- Patient-identifiable information (PII) must be anonymised or pseudonymised
- Data processing must comply with GDPR and the Data Protection Act (DPA)
- Access must follow role-based access control (RBAC)
- API endpoints must use encrypted communication (HTTPS)
- Data retention policies must be clearly defined

The project separates ingestion, transformation, analytics, and deployment layers to reflect secure system design principles.

## Model Governance

Healthcare ML systems require:

- Transparent evaluation metrics
- Bias assessment across demographic groups
- Continuous monitoring for data drift
- Clear documentation of model limitations
- Version-controlled model artifacts

This project includes:

- Reproducible training scripts
- Explicit feature engineering logic
- Versioned model artifact storage (GitHub Releases)
- Structured evaluation (ROC-AUC, recall analysis, threshold logic)

## Responsible AI in Healthcare

Machine learning systems in healthcare should:

- Support, not replace, clinical or operational judgement
- Be explainable to stakeholders
- Avoid unfair bias across population groups
- Be continuously monitored post-deployment

The modular architecture allows future integration of model monitoring, performance tracking, and audit logging.

# 4️⃣ Technical Implementation

## 🟤 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

- Original hospital patient encounter dataset
- Stored in `data/raw/`
- Represents ingested source data without transformation

This mirrors ingestion pipelines in cloud healthcare platforms.

---

## ⚪ Silver Layer (Cleaned & Structured Data)

- Data cleaning and validation
- Schema standardisation
- Missing value handling
- Feature engineering (time features, department encoding)
- Output stored as optimised Parquet

Script:

```
src/hospital_ops/data_loader.py
```

Output:

```
data/processed/encounters_clean.parquet
```

---

## 🟡 Gold Layer (Analytical Warehouse)

Built using DuckDB.

Purpose:

- Pre-aggregated daily patient metrics
- Department-level statistics
- Fast SQL-based analytical queries

Script:

```
src/hospital_ops/build_gold.py
```

Warehouse file:

```
warehouse/hospital_ops.duckdb
```

Gold tables include:

- `gold_daily_volume`
- `gold_department_waits`

This layer simulates analytical marts used in healthcare operations teams.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Layer

Model: Random Forest Classifier  
Target: `admitted` (binary classification)

Features:

- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Department ID
- Event hour
- Day of week
- Wait time

Training script:

```
src/hospital_ops/train_admission_model.py
```

Model artifact:

```
models/admission_model.joblib
```

Evaluation approach:

- ROC-AUC
- Recall analysis (operational risk perspective)
- Threshold-based classification logic

---

## ⚙ Backend (FastAPI)

Production API serving:

### Health Check

```
GET /health
```

### Admission Prediction

```
POST /predict
```

### Operational Metrics

```
GET /metrics/daily
GET /metrics/departments
```

Key characteristics:

- Loads model and warehouse via GitHub release artifacts
- SQL-based metrics queries
- Docker containerised
- Deployed on Render
- Separation of ML logic and API layer

---

## 🖥 Frontend (Streamlit Dashboard)

Interactive features:

- Admission probability calculator
- Daily patient volume trend
- Average wait time analysis
- Admission rate tracking
- Department-level comparison

Communicates with deployed FastAPI backend.

This mirrors real-world healthcare operational dashboards used by management teams.

# 5️⃣ Cloud Deployment Strategy

## Backend Deployment

Platform: Render

- Dockerised FastAPI service
- Artifact-driven model loading
- Environment-based configuration

Environment Variables:

```
MODEL_URL = GitHub release link to admission_model.joblib
DB_URL    = GitHub release link to hospital_ops.duckdb
```

---

## Frontend Deployment

Platform: Streamlit Community Cloud

- Separate frontend service
- Connected to production backend
- Scalable service separation

---
